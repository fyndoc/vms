In Master Data, you can create new SKUs and attach it to a category. The template linked to the category (as seen earlier in the [Template Doc](/docs/pim/template/create-templates#category-mapping)) will automatically apply to the SKU.

You can manually create new SKUs in Master Data, or it can also flow in through external sources, such as SAP (if you have integrated). If the mapping between SKU and category is established, all the attributes for that SKU would flow in through the template linked to the category.

In Master Data, you have 2 types of data: **Staged Master Data** and **Production Master Data**
