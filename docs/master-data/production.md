SKUs that have undergone all the task management processes such as content acquisition, content enrichment, and audit are present in the Production Master Data. 

SKUs synced to production after undergoing the task management processes would be available in the production database. Further, such SKUs will be available for consumption on sales channels or storefronts. 

Here, for the SKUs present in production, you can add the relationships created using [Relationship Builder](/docs/pim/relationships.md).

:::note
SKUs in production can also undergo task management processes (say partial content enrichment) if required.
