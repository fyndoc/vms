In e-commerce, templates refer to the grouping of attributes for a given category. 

For example, mobile chargers in the "Mobile Accessories" category may require attributes like colour, power output, and number of ports, while shirts in the "Casualwear" category may require attributes like size, colour, material, and number of pockets.

Therefore, by creating a template using Template Builder, you can decide the attributes a user will have to fill while creating a product.
