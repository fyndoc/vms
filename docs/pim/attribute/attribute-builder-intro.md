In e-commerce, product attributes refer to the specific characteristics or qualities that describe a product. These attributes provide detailed information about the product to help customers make informed purchasing decisions. This includes product name, brand, model number, price, dimensions, weight, material, colour, and many more.

Attribute Builder allows you to create such attributes for your brand from scratch, and manage it as per your requirement.
