## Introduction

On Catalog Cloud, you can create an account as:
* A brand
* A vendor

:::info When to choose Brand?
If you're an organisation that wishes to perform complete catalogue data management, enrol as a **Brand**. As a brand, you can create tasks for the internal and external parties (vendors) to perform content acquisition, enrichment, audit, and many more.

:::info When to choose Vendor?

If you're an organisation that wishes to offer services (say content enrichment) to a brand, enrol as a **Vendor**. The brand may periodically assign you tasks that you can accept and submit.
