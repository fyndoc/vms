## Introduction

Assume you are a catalogue manager who assigned a task to a team. At a later point in time, you have the flexibility to recall the task. 

Recalling is the process of rolling back the task and transferring it to someone else. Let's say, you assigned a task of enriching 300 SKUs to an external vendor. Assume that the vendor has worked on 100 SKUs and you wish to recall the task. In such a situation, you will be able to recall the task with 200 SKUs returning from `In Progress` state to their previous state. The 100 SKUs with `DONE` status will be unaffected since they were already worked upon. 

Next, you will get an option to create a new task out of the 200 SKUs you recalled. You can then assign the new task to some other vendor or team.

## Steps to Recall a Task

1. Go to the **Tasks** menu of your organization. It shows a list of all the tasks you created.

2. Click on the task you wish to recall. A **Task Detail** page would open.

3. Click the **More** button situated at the top-right corner.

4. Click **Recall Task**.

5. A dialog box would appear. Confirm the recalling process.

The task status would show as `Recalled` on the task listing page. The SKUs would now be a part of the new task you created.

:::caution Restriction
You can recall only those enrichment tasks you assigned to external vendors
