## Introduction

Assume you are a catalogue manager who assigned a task to a team. At a later point in time, you have the flexibility to reassign the task to someone else. 

Reassigning is the process of transferring a task to someone else. Let's say, you assigned a task of enriching 300 SKUs to `Person A`. Assume that `Person A` became unavailable for finishing the task due to an illness. In such a situation, you will be able to reassign the task to another member. The SKUs worked upon by the previous member and marked as `DONE` will be unaffected. Your new assignee gets only the remaining SKUs that were not worked upon by the previous member.

## Steps to Reassign a Task

1. Go to the **Tasks** menu of your organisation. It shows a list of all the tasks you created.

2. Click on the task you wish to reassign. A **Task Detail** page would open.

3. In the **Batches** section, click on the assignee (person to whom the batch is assigned).

4. A right-panel titled **Change Assignee** would appear, click the **Choose Assignee** dropdown.

5. Select the name of the person to whom you wish to assign the task.

:::tip Remember
You can reassign any type of task: Acquisition tasks, Enrichment tasks, or Audit tasks
