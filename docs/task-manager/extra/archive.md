This document is only meant for those responsible for creating tasks, i.e. catalogue manager or admin

## Introduction

Assume you are a catalogue manager who assigned a task to a team. At a later point of time, you have the flexibility to archive the task.

Archiving is the process of halting a task. Let's say, you assigned a task of enriching 100 SKUs to the CE team. Assume that the CE team has worked upon 25 SKUs and you wish to archive the task. In such a situation, you will be able to archive the task with 75 SKUs returning from `In Progress` state to their previous state. The 25 SKUs with `DONE` status will be unaffected since they were already worked upon.

## Steps to Archive a Task

1. Go to the **Tasks** menu of your organisation. It shows a list of all the tasks you created.

2. Click on the task you wish to archive. A **Task Detail** page would open.

3. Click the **More** button situated at the top-right corner.

4. Click **Archive Task**.

5. A dialog box would appear. Confirm the archiving process.

The task status would show as `Archived` on the task listing page.

:::tip Remember
You can archive any type of tasks: Acquisition tasks, Enrichment tasks, or Audit tasks
