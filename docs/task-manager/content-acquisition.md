## Introduction

Content acquisition is the process of acquiring source data for the enrichment of SKUs. A catalogue manager belonging to the brand selects the SKUs, creates a task, and assigns it to the content acquisition team (CA team).

## For Catalogue Manager's Reference

1. Go to **Master Data** â†’ **Staged Master Data**.

2. Choose the SKUs for which the CA team should acquire source data.

3. Click the **Create Task** button and choose **Content Acquisition Task**.

4. In the **Task Details** section, enter the following details - 
    * **Task Name** - Give a name to the task, e.g. `Smartphone SKU Data Sourcing`
    * **Task Description** - Write a brief description for the CA team to understand the purpose of the task.
    * **Task Deadline** - Mention the date and time by which you expect the CA team to finish the task.
    * **Task Priority** - Choose a task priority (Low, Medium, High) for the CA team to understand the importance of the task.
    * **Choose File** - If needed, attach other files that might be relevant for the CA team.

5. In the **Task Assigning** section, enter the following details - 
    * **Allocation Type** - Choose whether the task is for internal or external team. More often than not, content acquirers are internal to the brand, hence you may choose **Internal**.
    * **Split Task** - You can decide how the task should be split between the content acquirers. There are namely 2 options - 
        * **No Split** - Choose this option if the task cannot be divided because there is only one content acquirer (1 member).
        * **Equally** -  Choose this option if you want to divide the CA task equally between members of a team or independent members. This enables another field called 'Assign'.
    * **Assign** - Assuming that you chose equal split earlier, you have 2 options - 
        * **Team** - If you have created a team of content acquirers, choose this option to divide the task equally between the members of that team. A dropdown to choose the team would appear. Example -  If you chose 100 SKUs and you have a 4-member team, each member gets 25 SKUs for which they have to acquire the source data.
        * **Members** - If you have not created a team of content acquirers, choose this option to divide the task equally between individual content acquirers added to your organisation. A dropdown to choose the members would appear. Example -  If you chose 100 SKUs, and have a 3 independent content acquirers, first and second member get 33 SKUs each, and the third member gets 34 SKUs.

6. Click **Create Task**. This will also generate a Task ID.

You can also track a task from the **Task** menu (top navigation bar). It shows a list of all the tasks you created. The list helps you get a brief idea on the task type, status, deadline, assigned members, and many more.
