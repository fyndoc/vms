## Introduction

Content acquisition is the process of acquiring source data for the enrichment of SKUs. A catalogue manager belonging to the brand selects the SKUs, creates a task, and assigns it to the content acquisition team (CA team).

## Guide for Catalogue Manager

1. Go to **Master Data** â†’ **Staged Master Data**.

2. Choose the SKUs for which the CA team should acquire source data.

3. Click the **Create Task** button and choose **Content Acquisition Task**.

4. In the **Task Details** section, enter the following details - 
    * **Task Name** - Give a name to the task, e.g. `Smartphone SKU Data Sourcing`
    * **Task Description** - Write a brief description for the CA team to understand the purpose of the task.
    * **Task Deadline** - Mention the date and time by which you expect the CA team to finish the task.
    * **Task Priority** - Choose a task priority (Low, Medium, High) for the CA team to understand the importance of the task.
    * **Choose File** - If needed, attach other files that might be relevant for the CA team.

5. In the **Task Assigning** section, enter the following details - 
    * **Split Task** - You can decide how the task should be split between the content acquirers. There are namely 2 options - 
        * **No Split** - Choose this option if the task cannot be divided because there is only one content acquirer (1 member).
        * **Equally** -  Choose this option if you want to divide the CA task equally between members of a team or independent members. This enables another field called 'Assign'.
    * **Assign** - Assuming that you chose equal split earlier, you have 2 options - 
        * **Team** - If you have created a team of content acquirers, choose this option to divide the task equally between the members of that team. A dropdown to choose the team would appear. Example -  If you chose 100 SKUs and you have a 4-member team, each member gets 25 SKUs for which they have to acquire the source data.
        * **Members** - If you have not created a team of content acquirers, choose this option to divide the task equally between individual content acquirers added to your organisation. A dropdown to choose the members would appear. Example -  If you chose 100 SKUs, and have 3 independent content acquirers, the first and second member gets 33 SKUs each, and the third member gets 34 SKUs.

6. Click **Create Task**. This will also generate a Task ID.

You can also track a task from the **Task** menu (top navigation bar). It shows a list of all the tasks you created. The list helps you get a brief idea of the task type, status, deadline, assigned members, and many more.

3. Click on the batch assigned to you under the **Batches** section. A list of SKUs assigned to you for content acquisition activity would be visible on the **Batch SKUs** page.

4. Click on any SKU. An acquisition template would appear for that SKU.

5. Fill the following details in the acquisition template:
    * **Specs URL** - Enter a web link containing the entire specification and A-Z details about the SKU. This source data helps the content enricher understand the SKU in depth.
    * **Image URL** - Enter the link of images of the SKU. This source data helps the content enricher get the bonafide images of the SKU which can be further enhanced by the enricher.
    * **Attachment** - Add any other files (user guides, PDF, PPT) related to the SKU that would help the enricher.
    * **Additional URL** - If required, you may add other web links for the enrichers to refer to.
    * **Rich Media** - Choose `Yes`, if you want the enrichers to add videos, images, or multimedia links to the SKU.
    * **Long Description** - Choose `Yes`, if you want the enrichers to add a long description of the SKU for the storefront customers to read.
    * **Product Manual** - Choose `Yes`, if you want the enrichers to create a product manual for the SKU.
    * **FAQs** - Choose `Yes`, if you want the enrichers to create a list of commonly asked questions for the storefront customers to read.
    * **Support** - Choose `Yes`, if you want the enrichers to add support details.
    * **Notes** - Add an informal note to the enrichers if required.
    * **Priority** - You may set the priority to the SKU so that the enrichers know which SKUs to enrich first.

6. Click **Submit**. The task status will show as `DONE`.

In addition to the above details, there are more options (buttons) available to you:
* **Raise Query** - Use this option to raise an issue to the category team and get your queries resolved. The task status will show as `IN QUERY`.
* **Resolve Query** - (Visible only if you have raised a query) Use this option to close a query if you are satisfied with the resolution provided to you. The SKUs will come back to an `In Progress` state for you to work upon.
* **Don't Proceed** - Use this option if you have insufficient information about the SKU or if you have not received a proper resolution for the queries you raised. This puts the SKU on hold and it will not move to the enrichment stage. The task status will show as `DO NOT PROCEED`.

:::tip
Instead of doing the above steps for each SKU, you can directly mark multiple SKUs as `DO NOT PROCEED` or `IN QUERY` from the **Batch SKUs** page as seen in step 3.
